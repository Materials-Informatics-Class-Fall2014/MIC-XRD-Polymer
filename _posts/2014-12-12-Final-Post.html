# Project Definition

OOur dataset consisted of X-ray scattering intensity images from 12 different 
samples of polyethylene. While each of the samples were being strain, an 
X-scattering intensity image was taken roughly every four seconds. The twelve 
samples varied systematically between difference in densities, processing 
conditions, and thickness.
