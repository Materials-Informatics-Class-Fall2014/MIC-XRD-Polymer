# Project Definition

## Description

OOur dataset consisted of X-ray scattering intensity images from 12 different 
samples of polyethylene. While each of the samples were being strain, the 
stress in the sample was measured and an X-scattering intensity image was 
taken roughly every four seconds. The twelve samples varied systematically 
between difference in densities, processing conditions, and thickness.

the twelve samples.

In this project we worked towards generating structure processing linkage 
between the polyethene samples and the processing routs.
, taking each on of the X-ray scattering images and recovering the 2-point
spatial correlations. 

# Challenges 

A considerable amount of time was spent trying to recover the 2-point 
statistics from the Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) images. Although
we understood the need to take a Fourier transform of the image (a shown
in these two posts), we were unclear about the how to recover the local
state from the different in electron density
