# Project Definition

## Description

OOur dataset consisted of X-ray scattering intensity images from 12 different 
samples of polyethylene. While each of the samples were being strain, the 
stress in the sample was measured and an X-scattering intensity image was 
taken roughly every four seconds. The twelve samples varied systematically 
between difference in densities, processing conditions, and thickness.

the twelve samples.

In this project we worked towards generating structure processing linkage 
between the polyethylene samples and the processing routs.
, taking each on of the X-ray scattering images and recovering the 2-point
spatial correlations. 

# Challenges 

A considerable amount of time was spent trying to recover the 2-point 
statistics from the Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) images. Although
we understood the need to take a Fourier transform of the image (a shown
in [this](http://phelpsforpresident.github.io/MIC-XRD-Polymer/2014/09/17/2-Point-Statistics-and-Xray-Scattering.html)
post as well as [this](http://phelpsforpresident.github.io/MIC-XRD-Polymer/2014/10/15/Autocorrelation-from-X-ray-Scattering-Data.html)
 post), we were unclear as to how to  interpret the physical meaning of 
these real space plots.

Late in the semester, we were able to meet with [Dr. Garmestani](http://www.mse.gatech.edu/faculty/garmestani) 
from the Materials Science and Engineering department at Georgia Tech. In 
previous [research](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.actamat.2011.01.013) 
his group was able to recover pair correlation function  for a 2-phase 
material from SAXS data. From this information, we were able to [derive](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/phelpsforpresident/MIC-XRD-Polymer/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Relationship_between_XRD_and_Autocorrelation.ipynb) 
the relationship to get the 2-point statistics from the SAXS images.

$$ f^{11}( \pmb x) = \frac{1}{V \eta_o^2} \int I ( \pmb k) e^{-i\pmb k\pmb x} d\pmb k + V_1^2 $$

Unfortunately because we found this relationship too late in the semester to 
use the 2-point statistics for the linkage, but we are interested in using 
the 2-point statistics to do [microstructure reconstruction](dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.actamat.2007.10.044) 
from the SAXS images.
