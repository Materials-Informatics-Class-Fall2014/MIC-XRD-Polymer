# Project Definition

### Description

OOur dataset consisted of X-ray scattering intensity images from 12 different 
samples of polyethylene. While each of the samples were being strain, the 
stress in the sample was measured and an X-scattering intensity image was 
taken roughly every four seconds. The twelve samples varied systematically 
between difference in densities, processing conditions, and thickness.

The table below shows the density, thickness and processing condition for 
the twelve samples.

|0.912| 30 | A |
|0.912| 75 | A |

In this project we worked towards generating structure-processing linkage 
between the polyethylene samples and the strain applied to each sample.

# Challenges 

A considerable amount of time was spent trying to recover the 2-point 
statistics from the Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) images. Although
we understood the need to take a Fourier transform of the image (a shown
in [this](http://phelpsforpresident.github.io/MIC-XRD-Polymer/2014/09/17/2-Point-Statistics-and-Xray-Scattering.html)
post as well as [this](http://phelpsforpresident.github.io/MIC-XRD-Polymer/2014/10/15/Autocorrelation-from-X-ray-Scattering-Data.html)
 post), we were unclear how to  interpret the physical meaning of 
these images in real space.

Late in the semester, we were able to meet with [Dr. Garmestani](http://www.mse.gatech.edu/faculty/garmestani) 
from the Materials Science and Engineering department at Georgia Tech. In 
previous [research](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.actamat.2011.01.013) 
his group was able to recover pair correlation function  for a 2-phase 
material from SAXS data. From this information, we were able to [derive](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/phelpsforpresident/MIC-XRD-Polymer/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Relationship_between_XRD_and_Autocorrelation.ipynb) 
the relationship to get the 2-point statistics from the SAXS images.

$$ f^{11}( \pmb x) = \frac{1}{V \eta_o^2} \int I ( \pmb k) e^{-i\pmb k\pmb x} d\pmb k + V_1^2 $$

Unfortunately because we found this relationship too late in the semester to 
use the 2-point statistics for the linkage, but we are interested in using 
the 2-point statistics to do [microstructure reconstruction](dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.actamat.2007.10.044) 
from the SAXS images in the future.

# Collaboration

[Abhiram](https://github.com/phelpsforpresident) comes from the Materials 
Science and Engineering department, while [David](https://github.com/davidbrough1) 
comes from the Computational Science and Engineering department. Abhiram 
cleaned and selected the dataset for this project as well as contributed to 
posts and some coding. David coded most of the classes and function used for 
dimensionality reduction and the processing linkage. He also contributed to 
posts and worked out derivations. 

We had several conversations with [Dr. Kalidindi](http://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/kalidindi) 
that were useful in determining a project direction. We also met with [Dr. Garmestani](http://www.mse.gatech.edu/faculty/garmestani)
to discuss the relationship between X-ray data and pair correlation functions.

# Trials - Success and Failures

As mentioned [above](http://phelpsforpresident.github.io/MIC-XRD-Polymer/2014/12/12/Final-Post.html#Challenges), 
we spent significant time trying to understand the physical interpretation of 
the Fourier transform of the SAXS images. We believe we have a good enough 
understanding to generate the 2-point statistics as this project continues.

Originally PCA was used on the entire X-ray scattering image to do 
dimensionality reduction. This turned out to be somewhat slow because of the 
size of the images and because of some of the data structures were initially 
being used.

Later the [dimeion_reducer](https://github.com/phelpsforpresident/MIC-XRD-Polymer/blob/gh-pages/python_scripts/dimension_reducer.py)
class was created that would allow for flexibility in selecting a dimenionality 
reduction technique. This class was designed to integrate well with machine 
learn python package [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

After trying several variations on PCA, we found that [kernel PCA](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_kernel_pca.html) 
will a linear kernel gave us a reduced representation an order of magnitude 
faster than [PCA](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_pca_iris.html). 
We also explored [sparse PCA](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.SparsePCA.html) and
found that is gave similar results to PCA and kernel PCA, but we not as fast as 
kernel PCA.

We attempted to use a completely new framework for determining a 
structure-processing relationship. [Previously](dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.ijplas.2010.03.010)
a numerical integration approach has been used to construct these linkages. 
In this project we used a statistical model know as [transfer function model](http://www.le.ac.uk/ec/research/RePEc/lec/leecon/dp11-15.pdf). The transfer function model can be thought of as a method to use regression 
for digital filter design. 

A good transfer function model will have residuals that are temporally 
uncorrelated and combine to form a normal distribution. In our case, we found 
that a model with the order (2, 1, 5) gave us the best result. The 2 represents 
the number of autoregressive terms in the model, 1 represents the number of 
times the time series were differenced and 5 represents the time be previous 
time steps used from an exogenous (input) series. Our model equation took the 
following form.

$$ X_t= a_1 X_{t-1} + a_2 X_{t_2} + b_0 \varepsilon_t + b_1 \varepsilon_t + 
b_2 \varepsilon + b_3 \varepsilon + b_4 \varepsilon + b_5 \varepsilon + Err$$
