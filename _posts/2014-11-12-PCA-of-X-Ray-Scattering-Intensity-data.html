In this post we will provide the overall work flow for doing Principle Component Analysis on X-ray Scattering Data.

**Scaled SAXS X-ray Intensity Plot**

A class called [ImageDimensionReducer](https://github.com/phelpsforpresident/MIC-XRD-Polymer/blob/gh-pages/python_scripts/image_dimension_reducer.py)
was created to dimensionality reduction on image such as X-ray scattering data and/or 2-point statistics. 

[Here](https://github.com/phelpsforpresident/MIC-XRD-Polymer/blob/gh-pages/python_scripts/test.py) is an example of
how the class is used. It takes in an dimensionality reduction class from [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.decomposition)
and uses it to create a low dimensional representation the images loaded.

Below is an example of a plot the X-ray scattering data from one sample reduced using PCA.
