In this post we will show streamlines created by using PCA on X-scattering images, and a derivation to get the
relationship between SAXS intensity images and autocorrelation for a local state

# Processing Streamline from X-ray Scattering Intensity Images

The images below are three images of processing streamlines for twelve samples that an applied strain at each time
step.
