# 2-Point Statistcs from X-ray Scattering Data

The autocorrelation of the electron density is inversion Fourier transform of X-ray scattering intensity plot
(see [derivation](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/phelpsforpresident/MIC-XRD-Polymer/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Relationship_between_XRD_and_Autocorrelation.ipynb)).
