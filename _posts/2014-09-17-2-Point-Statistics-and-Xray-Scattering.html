# 2-Point Statistcs from X-ray Scattering Data

In this dataset we have both wide angle X-ray scattering plots (WAXS) and small angle X-ray scattering plots (SAXS).
The WAXS provides information on the crystal orientaiton of the crystalline regions, while the SAXS provides
information of 

The autocorrelation of the electron density is inversion Fourier transform of X-ray scattering intensity plot
(see [derivation](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/phelpsforpresident/MIC-XRD-Polymer/blob/gh-pages/notebooks/Relationship_between_XRD_and_Autocorrelation.ipynb)).
